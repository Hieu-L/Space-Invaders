# Space-Invaders

This repository contains my implementation of a video game console on a FPGA board (Basys3). The console runs Pong and Space Invaders, and is played using a Rotary Encoder or Accelerometer. 

This project was made as part of my Numerical Systems & Embedded Processor Course, and was coded in about 4 months.

I developped this game console by writing and simulating the numerical architectures on EDA-Playground, and then testing it on the FPGA board with the Vivado software.

All in all, this project helped me :
  - become more proficient with Hardware Description Languages.
  - improve my level of understanding in building and integrating numerical architectures.
  - understand how to use FPGA boards to develop more complex projects.
  
I've included my final presentation of the project in this repository, under the name "soutenance_LU3EE100_LE_CHANG (1).pdf" .

Have a nice day and keep on coding!
